        <h1 class="display-4">Hello I am Lillian Paris</h1>
        <p class="lead">Full-Stack Web Developer</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>I graduated Sabino High School in May of 2019, in Tucson, Arizona. I then persued my schooling at Pima
            Community College, at the East Campus. My chosen major in the fall of 2019 was Physocolgy. I then furthered
            my
            research in the medical field and applied for Pima Medical School and dropped out of the traditional Pima
            Community
            College. During my journey in the begining of 2020, I soon realized the medical field wasn't for me. In
            March of 2020,
            I found out the University of Arizona held a Coding Bootcamp; my interest grew as I reasearched the program
            more. The
            six months of education suited me more than 4+ years.</p>

                    nearby movie theatres. If the user accepts the 'Know your location' allert, our application will
                    display the closest five theatres nearest to the users area. The information includes the movie
                    theatre name, adress and zip code. After the user selects a cinema, the longitude and latitude will
                    then be stored into their local storage, where our Zomoto Api will use to display nearby eatieries.
